abstract = {The paper describes a solution for the Noetic End-to-End Response Selection challenge – one of the tasks of the 7th Dialog System Technology Challenge. The goal of the task is to select the most appropriate continuation of a dialog from a given set of responses. We approach this problem by building the ensemble of supervised neural network based classifiers and unsupervised similarity models. The dialog continuation is selected according to the score that aggregates rankings of candidate responses determined by models that participate in the ensemble.},
